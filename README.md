Using mapbox and openweathermap in your code can help you get access to a range of powerful tools for map and weather data. Mapbox and openweathermap allow developers to easily create weather-related applications and access real-time data. These tools enable developers to create interactive and engaging apps quickly and efficiently. **By learning how to use mapbox and openweathermap, developers can create amazing experiences for their customers and take their projects to the next level.**


# This Code

This code can provide learners with access to content from a variety of sources, allowing for multiple perspectives to be shared. The offers an opportunity for anyone to interact with content and form new connections, which can result in more engaging learning **experiences.**

## Step by Step!

Learning step-by-step involves breaking down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. Each step should be approached one at a time, and understanding should be reinforced after each one. With practice and patience, mastering a skill through a step-by-step approach is an **effective** way to learn.

## HTML

This code creates an HTML page that renders a map with directions from the Mapbox GL Directions API. It also includes a link to the Mapbox GL JS library and a link to the Mapbox GL Directions plugin. Additionally, it creates an element with the ID of "map" which will be used to display the map, and an element with the ID of "info" for displaying information about the map.

## MAPBOX 

Mapbox **provides powerful routing engines, accurate, traffic-powered travel times, and intuitive turn-by-turn directions to help you build engaging navigation experiences**.

## OpenWeatherMap

For each point on the globe,  **OpenWeather provides hyperlocal minute forecast, historical data, current state, and from short-term to annual and forecasted weather data**. All data is available via industry standard APIs.

## Functions

The `mapboxgl.accessToken` variable is used to store the Mapbox API Key and is used to access the Mapbox GL Directions API.

The `successLocation()` and `errorLocation()` functions are used to retrieve the user's current location. The `successLocation()` function sets up a map based on the longitude and latitude from the `position` object, while the `errorLocation()` function sets up a map with a default location.

The `doAjax()` function is used to make a GET request to a given URL using the XMLHttpRequest object in JavaScript. The function returns a promise that is resolved when the request is successful and rejected if there is an error. The data parameter passed to the function is used in the request body, while the url parameter is the address that is being requested. Once the request is successful, the responseText is passed as an argument to the fulfilled promise. Otherwise, the statusText is passed to the rejected promise.

The `setupMap()` function creates a map using the Mapbox GL JS library and sets the center of the map to the parameter 'center'. It also sets the zoom level to 5 and uses the navigation-night-v1 style. Additionally, it assigns a container element with the ID 'map' to the map.

The `map.on('click')` function is used to add a direction control to a map and listen for clicks on the map. When a click is detected, it will get the coordinates and longitude of the click position and make an API call to the OpenWeatherMap API. The API call will return data about the current weather at the click position. A Promise is created to handle the API call with the doAjax() function.
